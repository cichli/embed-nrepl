* Embed-nREPL

'Embed-nREPL' is a micro-library to start an nREPL server with my
opinionated defaults. I've found myself writing this a lot, so it's
time to make it a library!

What are my opinions, I hear you say? Not much.

- I include the default [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl][cider-nrepl]] middleware, at the latest stable
  version.
- I include the [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl/][refactor-nrepl]] middleware, at the latest stable
  version.

You can override either of these versions by including an explicit
override in your project.clj, or ~/.lein/profiles.clj

** Installation

Embed-nREPL is on Clojars:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [jarohen/embed-nrepl "0.1.0"]
#+END_SRC

Getting started:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (require '[nrepl.embed :as nrepl])

  ;; pop this somewhere, probably in your '-main'
  (nrepl/start-nrepl! {:bind "127.0.0.1"
                       :port 7888})

  ;; if you ever need to stop the running nREPL server:
  (nrepl/stop-nrepl!)
#+END_SRC

*** Notes

=:bind= is optional, and defaults to ="127.0.0.1"= - set it to
="0.0.0.0"= to listen on all addresses.

=start-nrepl!= is idempotent - if there's already a server started, it
won't start another.

** That's all, folks!

Any suggestions/bugs/etc - please report them in the traditional
Github manner - cheers! :)
